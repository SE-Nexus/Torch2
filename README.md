# Torch2 (Web) WIP

**Torch Web** is a complete web-based management suite for hosting, monitoring, and controlling **Torch** instances for **Space Engineers**.

It provides a centralized control panel that lets server administrators manage multiple Torch instances from anywhere, without needing direct access to the host machine.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Instance Management**  
  Start, stop, restart, configure and monitor multiple Torch instances from a single web interface.

- **Live Status & Metrics**  
  View uptime, world information, performance data, and instance health in real time.

- **Web-Based Control Panel**  
  No RDP or local access required — manage your servers securely through your browser.

- **Agent-Based Architecture**  
  Lightweight agents run alongside Torch instances and communicate with the web panel.

- **Scalable & Modular**  
  Designed to grow with your infrastructure, whether you’re running one server or many.

- **Modern .NET Stack**  
  Built using ASP.NET and Blazor for a fast, responsive, and maintainable experience.



## 🧠 Why Torch Web?

Managing Space Engineers servers traditionally requires manual setup, local access, and scattered tooling. Torch Web consolidates everything into a single, intuitive dashboard so you can:

- Reduce server downtime
- Monitor instances at a glance
- Automate common management tasks
- Scale your server environment with confidence


## 🛠️ Use Cases

- Community server hosting
- Dedicated Space Engineers server operators
- Multi-instance or multi-machine setups
- Remote server administration



## 📦 Project Goals

- Provide a **clean and reliable web UI** for Torch
- Maintain **strong typing and stability** across APIs
- Enable **real-time communication** between agents and the panel
- Keep deployment and configuration straightforward
